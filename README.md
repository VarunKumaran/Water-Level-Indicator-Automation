# Water-Level-Indicator-Automation

During this quarantine, I have noticed managing the water level of the tank in our home was a pretty burdensome job to do. There was often a huge amount of water that was being overflowed. And also there wasn't any proper monitoring system to monitor the water level in the tank. So I came up with a proposed solution to monitor the water level in the tank and at the same time, it will automatically ON/OFF the MOTOR based on the level of water in the tank. 

# Components needed:
1.Arduino UNO R3. // micro controller  

2.ULtrasonic sensor(HC-SR04). // To capture the level of water using trigger & echo method

3.Single channel 5V Relay module for arduino. // used to turn on/off the motor 

4.Buzzer. // to indicate that the tank is full & motor is turned off

5.3-Leds of your choice. // to indicate the level of water in the tank

6.Required jumper wires. (male-male,female-female,male-female)

7.Breadboard. (preferabbly small & cute)

8.Power Supply that converts 240V to 5V.

9.A two pole switch. 

10.4-core wire of required length //here length is from tank to the device.

11.A casing for the whole circuit, which is a good insulator.
