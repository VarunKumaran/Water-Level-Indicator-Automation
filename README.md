# Water-Level-Indicator-Automation

DESCRIPTION:
During this quarantine, I have noticed managing the water level of the tank in our home was a pretty burdensome job to do. There was often a huge amount of water that was being overflowed. And also there wasn't any proper monitoring system to monitor the water level in the tank. So I came up with a proposed solution to monitor the water level in the tank and at the same time, it will automatically ON/OFF the MOTOR based on the level of water in the tank.
